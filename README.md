# Live_CyberAttack
Setting up Azure Sentinel(cloud based SIEM) to map live cyber attacks . In this project we use a Virtual Machine in the cloud which is going to be a honey pot(Make it vulnerable) and we collect the records of ip addresses of the attackers using powershell script and send the data to the third party API to geolocate the attacks.
